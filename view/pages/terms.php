                of Game Changer. Prohibited commercial uses include without limitation any of the following actions
                taken without
                Game Changer's express written approval: (i) sale of access to the Website or their related services,

                amount of
                each such sale generated via the Game Changer Websites. Game Changer reserves the right to terminate any
                such sales

                may have with merchants, traders, or any other users.</h3>
            <p>You and Game Changer are independent contractors, and the Terms of Service are not intended to create,

            <p>Game Changer has developed a web interface that enables game enthusiasts to buy, sell, and trade games,
                learn, and interact with other game enthusiasts.
                Except for sales made through the Game Changer Store, sales and trades are between the merchant and the
                customer and not between Game Changer and the customer.
                If you experience any issues or problems with an order you place through a store or any product you
                receive, you should address them with the merchant. Game Changer
                is not responsible for any issues or problems you may have with the stuff you order from a third party
                or another user.</p>

            <p> Game Changer is not responsible if disputes arise between merchants, traders, or any other users. When
                you use our services, you release Game Changer from claims,
                damages, and demands of every kind — known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or

                Terms of Service or the Game Changer Community Rules. Game Changer reserves the right to decide whether
                a User Submission is appropriate and complies with these
